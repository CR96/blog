# blog

A personal blog built from scratch using Astro and Sanity Studio. To run the site, use:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can author new posts by visiting `/admin` in your browser.

If you plan on using TypeScript in your IDE, you'll need to run the type generation script any time the Sanity schemas are changed:

```
npm run types
```
