# #MILegTransit: Directory

This is a mirror of my Twitter coverage on transportation-related legislation in the 102nd Michigan Legislature, with clarifying commentary where needed. Organized by week of legislative session.

Eventually, subpages will be updated with native content rather than embedded tweets.

## Explanation of Coverage

I originally published [portions of this coverage on TRU's website](https://www.detroittransit.org/michigan-legislature-transit-watch/) alongside my personal Twitter account. Educating legislators old and new on the importance of funding frequent, reliable, and accessible public transportation is one of TRU's top priorities.

TRU is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and does not support, oppose, or contribute to any elected officials, candidates, or political parties.

## Legislative Directory: The Public Transit Caucus

On Wednesday, February 28th following session, [the inaugural meeting of the Public Transit Caucus was held in the Capitol.](https://housedems.com/morgan-mcfall-launch-bipartisan-public-transit-caucus/)

The caucus consists of members of the state legislature from both chambers and both parties. In the coming weeks and months, members are expected to draft policy related to RTA reform, a more permanent Local Bus Operations (LBO) funding increase, and, potentially, expansion of intercity bus and rail across Michigan.

## Legislative Directory: The Four Transportation Committees

Any introduced bills related to public transit funding will be referred to transportation committees in each chamber of the legislature. The Appropriations subcommittees are responsible for controlling MDOT's portion of the state budget.

Note that other committees may become relevant depending on a legislator's approach to funding transit initiatives.
