## Explanation of Coverage

I originally published portions of this coverage [on Transportation Riders United's website](https://www.detroittransit.org/michigan-legislature-transit-watch/) while serving as a member of the organization's Board of Directors. TRU is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and does not support, oppose, or contribute to any elected officials, candidates, or political parties.

Coverage of legislative activity on this blog, as well as my personal Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon accounts, represents my independent views unless otherwise noted.

<b>Update, 1/30/25:</b> This page now reflects committee assignments for the 103rd State Legislature (2025-26). For the 102nd Legislature, [see the archived directory page](https://coreyrowe.me/topics/legislative-updates/102nd_directory).

## The Transportation-Related Committees

Any introduced bills related to public transit funding will be referred to transportation committees in each chamber of the legislature. The Appropriations subcommittees are responsible for controlling MDOT's portion of the state budget.

Note that other committees may become relevant depending on a legislator's approach to funding transit initiatives.

For a complete list of legislators who are newly serving, are continuing to serve, and are no longer serving on each committee, [see the Committee Changes page](https://coreyrowe.me/topics/legislative-updates/103rd_committee_changes).

On Wednesday, February 28th following session, [the inaugural meeting of the Public Transit Caucus was held in the Capitol](https://housedems.com/morgan-mcfall-launch-bipartisan-public-transit-caucus/).

The caucus consists of members of the state legislature from both chambers and both parties. In the coming weeks and months, members are expected to draft policy related to RTA reform, a more permanent Local Bus Operations (LBO) funding increase, and, potentially, expansion of intercity bus and rail across Michigan.
